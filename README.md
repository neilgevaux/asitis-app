# README

This app is to collect anonymous feedback from nursery customers, which is stored in a list. It's prvisionally called "Asitis" (so you can tell it...as it is).

Customers add feedback through a form on the front end, and a checkbox to see if they are happy or not.

Managers can log in and view the feedback, and see a true/false boolean.
